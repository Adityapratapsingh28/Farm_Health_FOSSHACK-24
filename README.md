# Farm_Health - Farming made easy :seedling:

## Problem Statement ðŸ“š
Farmers in india due to lack of knowledge and awareness about plant disesae did'nt know that from which disesae thier plant is suffering from and which lead them to the huge ecomonic loss and crop wastage , many websites are there to help them but these websites are only available on English language , but since majorty of the farmers only knows thier regional and local languages.This language issue create more complication to communicate with them and to help them using usefull technology.

## Our Solution :computer:
Farm_Heath is specially decined  platform for  farmers , it uses neural networks to predict the disease of potato plant by just unploading the photo of leaf from your device, with the help of NLP it will also be providing insides on analysing the growth of fertiliser product  using sentimental analysis and summary of huge reviews in 5 lines . This website also be providing some useful farming laws and schemes given by our government which are available on regional languages such as hindi, english, & tamil .

## Key Features ðŸ¤–
- Plant disease prediction

   - Our Deep learning model will take the image of plant from user and predict the disease from which thbe plant is suffering from.

- Fertilizer analysis summarization

   - NLP model using webscrapping and month on month sentimental analysis on amazon reviews of each year given by user and it will provide the summary of all the reviews so the farmer can get a idea that how is the product is that product is going to help him or not.

- Website Interface: 

  - User-friendly website interface for easy interaction and navigation.
 
- Enhanced Model Training:

  - Our deep learning model is trained and tested and the accuracy is 98% , while our summarization analysis model is also performing good.

## Future Scope and Scalability & Contribution ðŸš€
- include more dataset of different plants so the farmers can predict different plants disease.
- add more languages such as bengali , marathi , bhojpuri , telegu , malayalam etc according to the location of the user.
- add a weather warning system for farmers that will warn farmer a day before of heavy rainfall or bad weather to reduce loss.
- add a chatbot which is available on difffernet languages to ease communication.
- add more fertilizer reviews to the website which will help farmers to buy good fertilizer that will not harm their crops.
